##  Project Overview

Timely delivery of orders is a critical factor in supply chain management, especially for healthcare products. Delays in delivery can disrupt the supply chain, reduce efficiency, and increase risk. This project focuses on classifying the delivery status of orders within a healthcare supply chain using machine learning techniques in Python.
Using a real-world dataset related to the transportation and pricing of healthcare goods—specifically, a dataset containing antiretroviral laboratory shipment records to supported countries—we aim to build a classification model that predicts whether an order will be delivered on time or late.

##  Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to assist supply chain managers in making better decisions regarding:

- Selecting the most reliable suppliers  
- Choosing the best type of order in terms of volume, shipping method, insurance, and agreements  
- Managing production, inventory, and risk more effectively  

By predicting the delivery status based on features like item value, insurance type, shipment volume, destination country, and other variables, decision-makers can proactively manage disruptions and improve overall supply chain performance.

##  Problem Understanding

Being able to predict whether an order will be delivered late or not is highly valuable for:
- Supplier selection  
- Inventory and warehouse management  
- Risk mitigation and disruption handling  

This data-driven approach helps managers assess conditions more accurately and make more reliable decisions. In this project, orders are classified into two categories:

1. **On-time/Early Deliveries**  
2. **Late Deliveries**  

The classification model is trained on historical shipment data using Python-based machine learning methods.

##  Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Data Preprocessing & Visualization using PandasGUI

##  Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Item type and value  
- Volume and weight  
- Insurance type  
- Shipping mode  
- Destination country
  
- Delivery status (Target Variable) has been created considering "scheduled delivery date" & "delivered to client date"


##  Outcome

The final model provides a classification output that can help decision-makers in the healthcare supply chain improve planning, minimize delays, and select the most suitable suppliers and shipping methods. 
The performance of each model is presented as below:
